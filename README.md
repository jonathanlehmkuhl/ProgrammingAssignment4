Final Project of the Coursera Course "Getting and Cleaning Data".

The [original data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) that should be cleaned contained data on human activity recognition using smartphones. Also see its [description](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

To run the script 'run_analysis.R' on the data set, the data folder 'UCI HAR Dataset' has to be in the working directory.

The script reads in the data set and produces an output data frame df_summarized.

For more information about the output data frame and the transformations that were performed take a look into the Codebook 'CodeBook.md'.
